**NOTE**
## Build #3 notes 

1 - Remember that all the data must be in JSON (including errors) *Never use echo*

2 - Use valitron or custom error handling exceptions

3 - Error handling: require to handle runtime errors on the server side and custom HTTP exception (for authentication as an ex) *Need to be discussed as a team: how do we handle errors ?*

4- Root resource is not important, just add the new end-points 

5 - Composite resource: At least one third-party REST-based API that is public and free. **for next week** the code for implementing it we already have it : from the lab with ajax (`Lab 5` #3 the helpers thingy) 

6 - Each member must implement at least one value-returning computation functionality (Ex : BMI calculator) the data sent must be as a POST method encoded in JSON. You need to validate each input. You are not suppose to read data from an API. It should be the result of a computation.You need to return the result of that computation. Omni calculator
